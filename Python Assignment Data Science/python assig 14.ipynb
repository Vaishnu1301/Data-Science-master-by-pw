    "hardware resources more effectively.\n",

    "network communication, file I/O, or other types of I/O that are blocking.\n",

    "Parallelism: Threading can be used to perform tasks in parallel, where multiple threads can work on the same task\n",

    "required to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization: Threading provides mechanisms for synchronizing access to shared resources, such as data\n",
    "structures or files, to avoid conflicts and ensure thread safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "activeCount(): The activeCount() function is used to get the number of thread objects that are currently active \n",

    "completed before exiting the program.\n",

    "to other functions for manipulation.\n",
