    "4Q. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans--> Data abstraction is a programming concept that allows you to define the interface of an object without \n",
    "revealing the underlying implementation details. In other words, it provides a way to separate the implementation \n",
    "details of an object from the way it is used by other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to achieve data abstraction in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction through classes: One of the most common ways to achieve data abstraction is through the use of classes.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, classes provide a way to define objects with certain properties and methods, but\n",
    "hide the underlying implementation details from the rest of the code. For example, you can define a class with \n",
    "public methods that expose its behavior, but keep the implementation details private.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: An interface is a collection of abstract methods that must be implemented by any class that implements\n",
    "the interface. Interfaces are used to define a common set of behaviors that can be implemented by different classes,\n",
    "without specifying the implementation details. For example, in Java, you can define an interface that specifies the methods that must be implemented by a class that implements the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules: In some programming languages, like Python, you can use modules to define a set of related functions and \n",
    "variables, and hide the implementation details behind a well-defined interface. Modules provide a way to \n",
    "encapsulate the implementation details of a set of functions, and expose them to the rest of the code through a \n",
    "simple API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information hiding: Information hiding is a programming concept that involves hiding the implementation details\n",
    "of an object or function behind a well-defined interface. Information hiding is used to protect the internal state\n",
    "of an object from being modified by external code, and to provide a clear and well-defined way for other objects \n",
    "to interact with the object."
